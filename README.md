# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to this project dedicated to providing solutions for LeetCode problems. 

Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Structure**: The solutions are organized by topic (i.e., "array", "linked list", "binary tree", etc.).

2. **Languages**: This project supports solutions in Python and Java. However, we are open to adding more languages.

3. **Conventions**:
   - **Problem statement**: The problem statement should be clearly stated in the beginning of the solution.
   - **Time complexity**: The time complexity of the solution should be included.
   - **Space complexity**: The space complexity of the solution should be included.
   - **Function/Method Signature**: The function or method signature should be provided to indicate the parameters and the return type.
   - **Sample Usage**: A sample usage of the function or method should be provided to demonstrate its usage.

Please feel free to contribute by opening issues, creating pull requests, or simply submitting a solution for a problem you've already solved. Remember to adhere to the structure, guidelines, and conventions mentioned above.

Let's get started! Happy coding!
